Time to save save mother nature🌴🎄
This website isn't out to the public just yet and is still unfinishe. We are still upgrading and enchancing it. 

##Overview
 - The main purpose of this project is to educate the general public on the substantial carbon dioxide emissions from everyday vehicles. It fosters a friendly competition to empower youth, highlighting the urgent negative impacts of CO2 on our planet and inspiring collective action for a sustainable future.

## How it works
- Users input daily habits like vehicle usage, fuel type, or travel distance via a form-based calculator to generate a personalized "carbon score".
- The app displays progress graphs for tracking improvements over time.
- It enables sharing results on social media to spread awareness.
- Friendly competitions feature weekly/monthly "go green" challenges, where the lowest score wins badges or awards.
- Notifications prompt users for regular score updates to maintain engagement.
- Leaderboards foster youth participation by highlighting top performers and planetary impact.
